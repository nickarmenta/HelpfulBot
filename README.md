# HelpfulBot

HelpfulBot uses a "teach by prompt" approach to cobot machine tending. Instead of manually programming, users are provided a list of questions to guide them towards a final program. This creates an even more user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for training.

## Usage

1. Save all files in ['UR/'](UR/) to your robot's program directory.
2. Load ['HelpfulBot'](UR/HelpfulBot.urp) and follow the prompts!

### To-do

* Create shell scripts to automate program upload
* Add additional functionality outside of machine tending
* Encode script file into QR code for instantaneous loading via interpreter port 30002
* Incorporate NLP for further application guidance and more conversational instruction
