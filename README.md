# HelpfulBot

HelpfulBot uses a "teach by prompt" approach to cobot programming. Instead of hard-coding, users are provided a list of questions to guide them towards a final program. This creates a even more user-friendly interface that lowers the amount of training required for robot programming.

## Usage

IN PROGRESS. Currently this is only a function call for one-time programming that is not saved into memory.

### To-do

* Save global variables to installation file
* Add additional functionality outside of machine tending
* Encode program into QR code for instantaneous loading via interpreter port 30002
* Incorporate NLP for further application guidance and more conversational instruction
